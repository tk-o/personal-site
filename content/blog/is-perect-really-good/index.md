## Chasing perfection
I may not know you, but Iâ€™m going to make a guess about you: you tend to be a perfectionist and you donâ€™t even think about it.

I donâ€™t mean to sound assuming (or oafish!). Iâ€™m in part reflecting on my own experience â€“ Iâ€™ve been perfectionist in many situations, myself.

In my case it happens always when I deeply care about making something important (at least from my point of view). It has to be A-ok, as I really want it to be successfull. I have all these great feelings, things go well in my mind. And then nothing happens; literally.

Example? Here you go: each time I start wondering about a new initiative I tend to overthink, while actually not doing anything for real. Can you imagine how many times I was trying to create a space where I could share my experience and knowdlege with other people? More than a dozen! And it took all these domain names I bought so far for every single attempt ðŸ˜Ž I used to always stop at this point, as I couldn't decide on how to continue, what to share and with whom. Having a domain name everything I could achieve, back in the day. And nothing else was there. Oh, plus the domain name registration fees ðŸ™ƒ

Another case, this time from my professional life. I've been working as a software engineer since 2006. All the time I was trying to re-create the functionality using better technology, better techinques and making it better to use. At least I thought so. In many situations the outcomes were not that significant as I wanted them do be. This is because I was focused on improving things that were already good. They'd been working well, before I even stared making my improvements. This is an excellent example of trying to make something perfect instead of moving on to the next challange.

I hope the examples above helped you to understand where I come from. I feel these hard times are gone for me now! Furthers, I'll describe what I learnt over all these years on how to deal with keeping a comfortable balance between the expectations and the outcomes.

### Setting the bar (too) high

Let me justify what I said in the very first paragraph:
> you tend to be a perfectionist and you donâ€™t even think about it

I based my assumpion on <strong>Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale</strong> (MPS; variants: [MPS I](http://www.sjdm.org/dmidi/Multidimensional_Perfectionism_Scale_I.html), [MPS II](http://www.sjdm.org/dmidi/Multidimensional_Perfectionism_Scale_II.html)).

I'd like to use [_MPS II_ sub-scales](http://dl.motamem.org/Hewitt-Flett-Perfectionism-Scale-MPS.doc) so you could evaluate yourself if you've ever been a perfectionist. Below are a few examples (groupped by a sub-scale) of a perfectionsit thinking.

#### self-oriented perfectionism
- When I am working on something, I cannot relax until it is perfect
- It is very important that I am perfect in everything I attempt
- I must always be successful at school or work

#### other-oriented perfectionism
- I have high expectations for the people who are important to me
- I canâ€™t be bothered with people  who wonâ€™t strive to better themselves
- I cannot stand to see people close to me make mistakes

#### socially prescribed perfectionism
- I find it difficult to meet othersâ€™ expectations of me
- Anything that I do that is less than excellent will be seen as poor work by those around me
- People expect nothing less than perfection from me

### My evaluation based on [_MPS II_](http://dl.motamem.org/Hewitt-Flett-Perfectionism-Scale-MPS.doc)
I discovered that I've shifted from matching _self-oriented perfectionism_ characteristic to _socially prescribed perfectionism_ one. I'm more relaxed when it comes to what I expect from myself when there's no external pressue. However, while seeing how my environment react on the outcomes of my actions, I feel motivated to be perfect and present better results ðŸ˜±

Wow! Writing a post and finding out about such facts â€“ it's intense! 

## Good enough is OK

I wouldn't say that it's possible to stop being a perfectionist entirely. But it's possible to learn how to minimize the negative side of perfectionism.

As I discovered before, there's always some kind of force driving your actions. It's either you, the people you care of, or your environemnt. What I think, is most important here, is finding a balance among these three forces. I'll tell you now, what's my take on that!

### It doesn't have to be crazy
This is very personal question to ask: what really makes one happy? In my case, the answer is:
> spending time on things that I find valuable, and reduce the time I spend on something not relevant to me.

As I mostly do things that I like (I'm really lucky I'm able to!), I'd rather focus on minimizing the presence of an irrelevant things happening around me.

#### Only important is what's important

In my personal life, what I think works really well for me is not watching TV. I find it only stealing the time. Once you think about it: when was the last time you learnt about anything useful in day to day life from the TV? The time I save on not watching the TV can be spent on learning about communication, psychology and other topics that currently fascinate me. Another thing that I'd rather exchange the TV time for is body-weight workout. It helps to stop thinking and start breathing. When the body is occupied, the mind can relax - and vice-versa!
