### Story of my life

I just reminded myself about something from I saw in my junior high-school times. It was a sentence written on a wall in one of classrooms. It went like this:
>>> I hear and I forget, I see and I know, I do and I understand.

Well, this is so self-explaining sentence! It's easy to hear, and then forget about it. Once you read it, you think you know what it means. But only after many attempts of trying various things, you start to understand what it's been about all that time: **DOING**.

I'm keen to learn new things from books and articles I read. Same for courses I watch, and podcasts I listen to. <em class="highlight">Wait a second! Reading, watching, listening to... it's not how I would be able to understand the topic I explore!</em> It'd be good to actually **LEARN** anything from these efforts, right?
 
### Learn in Private vs Learn in Public
Let's start with **learn in private**. This is a usual way people learn and solve their problems. I've been following this way too often. I used to get things done and don't really bother to share the path to finding a solution. To be honest, there's nothing wrong in it. I still was getting things done. But I feel I could get way more out of it. And that's a reason why I'm contibuting to this very blog!

Let's move on and walk through a better way of learning ðŸš€

### Learn in public
I first read about it at [Swyx's site](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public). The idea itself is pretty general â€” I came up with my interpretation. Long story short: <em class="highlight">you are able to better understand a topic while you're teaching it to somebody</em>. In fact, it's quite simple: you'd like a person you're teaching to get only the best of your knowledge and experience. That's why you prepare better, and explore deeper. <abbr title="There you are">VoilÃ </abbr>! I'd also say, that the very first person you should be willing to teach is... you! That's an important aspect that makes particular piece of information subjective. In other words, makes it unique. People seek for the uniqueness. And you should too ðŸ™ƒ

OK, that's enough of introduction, let's go to examples.

#### I've been doing it already
I graduated from a univeristy after studying for 5 years. Over that time I had to take many exams. Some of them were easier, and some of them were almost impossible to pass. And yet, I made it ðŸ™ƒ A secret behind these harder ones was meeting as a group with my folks and prepare together. We were sitting in one room, going through exercies our lecturer shared for the students to prepare. Noone had all the answers. But together, we were able to solve the problems and get a good level of understanding about the particular solution. This way we all made it through these years!

#### Time to go on-line
How to teach someone if you're not really a teacher? Here's the thing that comes for free in the on-line world. <em class="highlight">If you make your findings (notes, code snippets, blog posts etc.) **public** on the Internet, everyone looking for it has chance to see it, and learn from it!</em> Congrats, you're a teacher now, but you don't know your class yet ðŸ˜Ž On a serious note, that's how the Internet works. Whatever you share publically, people can find. Sometimes they learn from it and it helps them solving their problem. Just give them that opportunity.

>>> Try your best to be right, but don't worry when you're wrong. Repeatedly.

I cannot agree more!

### Expected outcomes
Below, I present my own list of the most important results to get out of the **learn in public**:

1. A deeper understanding of a particular problem. This is where my future self will be most grateful to my past self. I will have a reviewable archive of my work and all of the things I learned about.
2. Improving communication channels. I have many ideas. I want to convey them clearly to other people. I don't want these ideas to live only in my mind.
3. Gaining audience. I would be happy if anyone found the content I created helpful. It also could be a way to receive feedback on the learnings I share. What's great about this point is a fact that people come to you, and you don't even have to reach out.
4. Building capital. What I create under my name, it's mine. What's cool about capital is that you can turn it into incomes. But first things first, this is the last point for a reason.
