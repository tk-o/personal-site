## Story of my life

I just reminded myself about something from I saw in my junior high-school times. It was a sentence written on a wall in one of classrooms. It went like this:
>>> I hear and I forget, I see and I know, I do and I understand.

Well, this is so self-explaining sentence! It's easy to hear, and then forget about it. Once you read it, you think you know what it means. But only after many attempts of trying various things, you start to understand what it's been about all that time: **DOING**.

I'm keen to learn new things from books and articles I read. Same for courses I watch, and podcasts I listen to. <em class="highlight">Wait a second! Reading, watching, listening to... it's not how I would be able to understand the topic I explore!</em> It'd be good to actually **LEARN** anything from these efforts, right?

## The concept
**Learn in public**: I first read about it at [Swyx's site](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public). Long story short, you are able to better understand a topic while you're teaching it to somebody. In fact, it's quite simple: you'd like a person you're teaching to get only the best of your knowledge and experience. That's why you prepare better, and explore deeper. <abbr title="There you are">VoilÃ </abbr>!

### I've been doing it already
I graduated from a univeristy after studying for 5 years. Over that time I had to take many exams. Some of them were easier, and some of them were almost impossible to pass. And yet, I made it ðŸ™ƒ A secret behind these harder ones was meeting as a group with my folks and prepare together. We were sitting in one room, going through exercies our lecturer shared for the students to prepare. Noone had all the answers. But together, we were able to solve the problems and get a good level of understanding about the particular solution. This way we all made it through these years!

### Time to go on-line
How to teach someone if you're not really a teacher? Here's the thing that comes for free in the on-line world. <em class="highlight">If you make your findings (notes, code snippets, blog posts etc.) **public** on the Internet, everyone looking for it has chance to see it, and learn from it!</em> Congrats, you're a teacher now ðŸ˜Ž On a serious note, that's how the Internet works. Whatever you share publically, people can find. Just give them that opportunity.

### The outcomes
Below, I present my own list of the most important results to get out of the **learn in public**:

1. A deeper understanding of a particular problem. This is where my future self will be most grateful to my past self. I will have a reviewable archive of my work and all of the things I learned about.
2. Improving communication channels. I have many ideas. I want to convey them clearly to other people. I don't want these ideas to live only in my mind.
3. Gaining audience. I would be happy if anyone would find the content I created helpful. It also could be a way to receive feedback on the learnings I share.
4. Making profit. To get here, I first need to achieve the TOP 3 points.

>>> Try your best to be right, but don't worry when you're wrong
