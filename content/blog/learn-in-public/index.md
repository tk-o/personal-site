### Story of my life

I just reminded myself about something from I saw in my junior high-school times. It was a sentence written on a wall in one of classrooms. It went like this:
>>> I hear and I forget, I see and I know, I do and I understand.

Well, this is so self-explaining sentence! It's easy to hear, and then forget about it. Once you read it, you think you know what it means. But only after many attempts of trying various things, you start to understand what it's been about all that time: **DOING**.

I'm keen to learn new things from books and articles I read. Same for courses I watch, and podcasts I listen to. <em class="highlight">Wait a second! Reading, watching, listening to... it's not how I would be able to understand the topic I explore!</em> It'd be good to actually **LEARN** anything from these efforts, right?
 
### Knowledge silo
Let's start with a typical way people learn and solve their problems. That usually was my apporach. I used to get things done and not really bother to share a path of finding the solution. Everything would stay in my head. And because of that, I wasn't able to re-think my actions and outcomes. I belive it made me already to foregt some of the experience I gained. I can sum that approach as: consuming knowledge without creating its improved version myself. 

Although, something's changed. Recenlty, I started to notice that making my knowledge and experience public, helps me a lot. It lets me think again and sometimes see what I couldn't see before. Below, I share what I finally started to understand about an optimal learning process. So bear with me and let's move on!

Time to walk through that exciting topic üöÄ

### Learn in public
I first read about it at [Swyx's site](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public). Long story short: it's about being a knowledge multiplier (more details on the linked page). Anytime you find a new piece of information, you are able to pass it along. I think we can extend that summary here. You can also add your own interpretation and create a unique content, an improved version of the original knowledge. I really like this part ‚ö°Ô∏è That's how innovation begins.

Great! Now it's time to talk about being a teacher. You want to teach someone the knowledge and experience you have, right? üôÉ But how to teach anyone if you're not really a teacher? Here's the thing that comes for free in the on-line world. <em class="highlight">If you make your findings (notes, code snippets, blog posts etc.) **public** on the Internet, everyone looking for such piece of information has their chance to see it, and learn from it!</em> Congrats, you're a teacher now, but you don't know your class yet üòé On a serious note, whatever is shared publically, people can find. Sometimes they learn from it and it helps them solving their problem. Just give them that opportunity to be your class (<abbr title="also known as">a.k.a.</abbr> audience).

#### Downsides
Not everything is great, though. Getting your ideas public can be scary (at least at the begining). I was initially affraid about how my blog idea will be received by others. But hey, that's what I wanted to happen after all ‚Äî I wanted to [provide value](/how-to-provide-value/) and see if anyone needs it. üòé

>>> Try your best to be right, but don't worry when you're wrong. Repeatedly.

I cannot agree more! I know that I learn constantly. That's the way I live. My area of interest keeps changing over time. I start learining the topics I have no clue about, but it doesn't change my attitude.

#### Hey, I've been doing it already... an old-school way
I graduated from a univeristy after studying for 5 years. Over that time I had to take many exams. Some of them were easier, and some of them were almost impossible to pass. And yet, I made it üôÉ A secret behind these harder ones was meeting as a group with my folks and prepare together. We were sitting in one room, going through exercies our lecturer shared for the students to prepare. Noone had all the answers. But together, we were able to solve the problems and get a good level of understanding about the particular solution. We were looking for information, solving problems, discussing the solutions and sharing among each other. This way we all made it through these years!

### The cycle
There are a few steps before I make my lerarnings public. I follow them to make the content I create subjective and unique. I also want it to be easy do digest and not too boring. Remember, this is a cycle.

Staying in that cycle helps me to excercise my creativity. I read this the other days:

>>> Creativity is the brain's invisible muscle.

I wish I knew about it earlier! Altough, now I understand it and below is the proof that it works.

#### Getting context
Let's say I want to learn how to present my ideas in a clear way. I really do üôÇ I started thinking on what will be required for it to happen. Here are a few ideas:
- visual notes taking, by drawing sketchnotes,
- creating mind maps, by going from a high-level perspective into more detailed ones,
- making presentation logical, by talking first about problems, then about solutions (I always do the opposite ü§ê).

#### Trying it out
So far I've been playing with mind maps. You can try it too ‚Äî have a glance at [whimsical.com](https://whimsical.com/mind-maps/) examples.

#### Reflection
Thanks to the mind mapping experience, I noticed that I tend to go into the details too quickly. All my professional life I've been looking for solutions. And I know I need to be looking for problems more. This is a great outcome I could only get beacuase of trying the mind maps out. What's more, I think I'd like to learn sketchnoting, as more advanced form of a mind map excercise. <em class="highlight">This one mind map thing got me into **the cycle** ‚Äî it's so powerful!</em>

#### Go live!
Here's the moment I have something to share with you. I hope the things I wrote above proove the cycle I'm talking about in this section. I feel really great about finding new ways to form my thoughts and make them available on this blog.

### What's more?
Below, I present my own list of the most important results to get out of the **learn in public**:

1. A deeper understanding of a particular problem. This is where my future self will be most grateful to my past self. I will have a reviewable archive of my work and all of the things I learned about.
2. Improving communication channels. I have many ideas. I want to convey them clearly to other people. I don't want these ideas to live only in my mind.
3. Gaining audience. I would be happy if anyone found the content I created helpful. It also could be a way to receive feedback on the learnings I share. What's great about this point is a fact that people will come to me, and I don't even have to reach out.
4. Building capital. What I create under my name, it's mine. The long-term vision and compound interest are my friends here.
